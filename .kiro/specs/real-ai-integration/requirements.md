# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves replacing the existing rule-based AI chatbot with a real AI backend integration while maintaining all existing functionality including user memory, progress tracking, and visual design consistency. The enhancement will integrate either Hugging Face Inference API or OpenAI API to provide genuine AI responses while preserving the current UI/UX design from the Figma screens.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with a real AI chatbot instead of pre-programmed responses, so that I can have more natural and helpful conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL send the message to either Hugging Face Inference API or OpenAI API
2. WHEN the AI API responds THEN the system SHALL display the response in the chat interface matching the Chat - 2.jpg design
3. WHEN the AI generates a response THEN the system SHALL include a dummy image placeholder next to the response as shown in the UI mockups
4. IF the API call fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user
5. WHEN the user types a message THEN the system SHALL show typing indicators and loading states as per the UI design

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to remember our previous conversations and my progress, so that I can have continuous and personalized interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a new conversation THEN the system SHALL load their previous conversation history from memory
2. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL store both the user message and AI response in the memory system
3. WHEN a user returns to the app THEN the system SHALL maintain their conversation context across sessions
4. WHEN the system calls the AI API THEN it SHALL include relevant conversation history for context
5. WHEN memory storage fails THEN the system SHALL continue functioning but log the error appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my mood and progress tracked visually, so that I can monitor my improvement over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes interactions THEN the system SHALL update their progress data
2. WHEN the user views the progress screen THEN the system SHALL display the MoodChart component with current data
3. WHEN progress data changes THEN the system SHALL persist the updates to maintain historical tracking
4. WHEN the AI provides motivational content THEN the system SHALL correlate this with mood tracking metrics
5. IF progress data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL initialize with default values and continue functioning

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to match the exact design specifications, so that I have a consistent and polished experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat screen loads THEN the system SHALL replicate the exact layout from Chat - 1.jpg and Chat - 2.jpg
2. WHEN displaying text THEN the system SHALL use Poppins and Quicksand fonts as specified
3. WHEN rendering UI elements THEN the system SHALL extract and apply exact colors from the provided UI screens
4. WHEN showing interactive elements THEN the system SHALL apply matching shadows, gradients, and rounded corners from the designs
5. WHEN using icons THEN the system SHALL use the provided icon files from the Icons folder without modification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to choose between Hugging Face and OpenAI APIs based on performance and reliability, so that I can ensure the best user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the AI backend THEN the system SHALL support configuration for either Hugging Face Inference API or OpenAI API
2. WHEN an API is selected THEN the system SHALL handle authentication and rate limiting appropriately
3. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL parse and format them consistently regardless of the chosen provider
4. IF one API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging without breaking the application
5. WHEN switching between APIs THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation continuity and memory functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to generate images alongside text responses, so that I can have a richer conversational experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI provides a text response THEN the system SHALL display a dummy image placeholder next to it
2. WHEN the image placeholder is shown THEN it SHALL match the positioning and styling from Chat - 2.jpg
3. WHEN preparing for future image generation THEN the system SHALL structure the code to easily replace dummy placeholders with real generated images
4. WHEN displaying the image placeholder THEN it SHALL not interfere with text readability or chat flow
5. IF image display fails THEN the system SHALL continue showing text responses without breaking the chat experience
